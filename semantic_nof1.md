## Abstract


## Introduction

Much has been written about the education of healthcare professionals regarding {{condition}} <!-- ref -->. Despite a substantial body of knowledge, however, to our knowledge all to date studies consistently fail to recognize that different educational methods will have different degrees of effectiveness under different situations. For example, <!-- ref -->. In other words, this "herd approach" assumes that one size fits all, which is in opposition to a personalized approach which takes into consideration that even the same healthcare provider might learn differently under different circumstances. 

<!-- lit review on education of the condition -->

While trial designs based on groups are the most common, they are not the only option. N-of-1 trials have been used in a variety of clinical circumstances, with a recent increase in their application given their special role in personalized medicine. <!-- define and cite our paper  --> <!-- lit review explain that nof1 is aggregated through meta-analyses, thus requiring a high degree of standardization which is currently absent -->

Given this knowledge gap in the field of <!-- condition -->, this study describes an N-of-1 educational trial comparing {{interventions}} to evaluate satisfaction, knowledge and impact in daily clinical practice regarding {{area}}, following a semantic reproducible protocol.

### Stopping rules

Since this is an educational trial did not present any significant risk greater than what would be encountered in regular daily activities, the only stopping rule was related to the unintended release of identified data. This event did not occur and so no stopping rules were applied during the course of this study.

### Randomization

Delivery through edx - hidden and released every week


### Semantic reproducible research framework
